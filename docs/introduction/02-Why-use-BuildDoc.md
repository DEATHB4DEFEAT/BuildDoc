# **Why use BuildDoc?**
> Here's a list of reasons you may want to use BuildDoc instead of Makefile:
> - **Simpler syntax.**
> 	- Don't get me wrong, Makefile isn't that hard, but it can certainly be confusing if you're new to using it.
>
> - **Easier install on Windows.**
> 	- Seriously, installing Makefile on Windows is annoying (at least from my experience). <!-- Probably because it's Windows. -->
>
> - **Smaller in size.**
> 	- BuildDoc comes installed as a binary and a config file in a directory (`~/.builddoc` or `C:\.builddoc`). Nothing more, nothing less.
